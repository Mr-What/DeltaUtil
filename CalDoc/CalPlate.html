<H1 center>Calibration of Delta 3D Printers using a calibration plate</H1>

<BODY STYLE="font-family: Arial, Helvetica">

One issue with the calibration of deltabots is that while it is relatively
easy to probe bed level, it is difficult to determine an accurate XY position.
If a linear-delta printer is built perfectly, with absolutely parallel towers,
absolutely perpendicular to the bed, with perfect arms and end effector linkages,
this is not a problem.  However, in practice, there are always
construction imperfections.
These imperfections can cause distortions in the XY plane.
It can sometimes be better to have calibrated parameters which sacrifice
bed flatness for low distortion (higher accuracy) in the XY plane.
The residual bed-flatness error can be removed by an automatic
bed-leveling procedure (a.k.a. bed tram compensation).

<P>See my earlier
<A HREF="Calibration.html">musings on calibration</A>
for a more in-depth discussion.

<P>I had earlier proposed a technique which uses numerous measurements
on a calibration print in the calibration procedure to reduce XY distortions.
While this technique does work, it is limited by errors in measurement,
printing, and part warpage when the plastic cools.
It also assumes that the print spread is anisoplanatic, where on most printers
it is not.
I know that my blower is not completely uniform, and spread around the nozzle
is not uniform.

What if we fitted the printer with a CNC probe needle sensor,
and searched probes of a precision machined plate mounted on top of the print
bed like this one.
We could perform interactive bed probes, searching for the
bottom of the calibration holes.
This would give us printer settings at known, complete 3D XYZ positions
to feed into a calibration parameter optimization.

Another way to accomplish this would be to create a flat calibration target
with little fiducials, most likely + symbols, which can be attached to the printbed.
A small camera, with macro focus, could be mounted to the end-effector, and used
to track the fiducials for known XY positions.
A traditional bed probe, also attached to the end-effector, could be used
to estimate bed levels, albeit at an offset from the camera points.

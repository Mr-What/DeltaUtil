<title>Delta Calibration Tools</title>
  </head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica">
These are some tools to compute calibration adjustments
for a delta-style 3D printer using the Marlin firmware.

<p>Adjustments are computed only for the DELTA_RADIUS firmware setting,
and the endstop offsets, as are set by the M666 command.
It is assumed that all towers are equally spaced around the <em>center</em>,
and that the length of the delta rods was carefully measured, and set
properly in the DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD macro of Configuration.h.

</p><p>Most people will want to use the auto bed-leveling probe function
to take levels of the bed height.
If you use pronterface to command the auto-level probe, it will
print information like this back to the console:</p><pre>   ...
   Bed x: 40.00 y: -60.00 z: 5.24
   Bed x: 20.00 y: -60.00 z: 5.07
   ...
   Bed x: -20.00 y: 60.00 z: 5.33
   Bed x: -40.00 y: 60.00 z: 5.25
   -0.51 0.07 -0.00 -0.10 -0.13 0.04 0.21
   ...
</pre>

<P>If you have implemented a G30 command that does a single bed height probe,
and no other actions, you can use a gcode script to perform a bed-probe
at arbitrary resolution.
<A HREF="http://boim.com/DeltaUtil/bedProbeRandGrid.pl">
This script</A>
probes about 81 points, 3 times each, in random order to try
and average out any backlash effects.
Parameters can be edited to fit your printbed.
If you use this script, with a tripple check on every probe point,
you can average these values with this octave command:<PRE>
     bed = sampleMeans(bed);
</PRE>
It may be a good idea to plot your bed probes:<PRE>
     plot3(bed(:,1),bed(:,2),bed(:,3),'.');grid on
</PRE>
and verify that repeated readings of each probe point are within
acceptable tolerance.

<P>In a terminal window, run the follwing command:<pre>   perl extractProbeData.pl &gt; myBed.dat
</pre>
It will wait for input.
<br>Copy all of the <tt>Bed...</tt> lines from pronterface, and paste
them into the window running the <tt>extractProbeData.pl</tt> script,
then press &lt;CR&gt;ctrl-D, and the script should terminate.
<p>When complete, the script should have produced a myBed.dat file that has contents like:</p><pre>     40.00 -60.00 4.53

<p>If you do not have a bed leveling probe, you can manually check the
nozzle height over the bed, and note the position with the M114 command.
I have a similar script to create a data file like the one above from M114
output called <tt>extractM114.pl</tt>.
I have used this by sliding a microscope slide under the nozzle to find
how low I can go before I touch the slide.

</p><h3>Data Analysis in Octave (or MATLAB)</h3>
 
<p>In a folder containing this code, and the <tt>myBed.dat</tt> file
start up an <tt>octave</tt> session.</p><pre>   octave
</pre>
Load the data with a command like:<pre>   bed = load('myBed.dat');
</pre>
You may wish to remove the Z axis bias.
I measured this by hand on my printer using the microscope slide technique,
and placed the setting in the Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER macro.
In my case, this distance is 5.2mm, so I correct my bed probe data
with a command like:<pre>   bed(:,3) = bed(:,3) - 5.2;
</pre>
If I were correcting manually taken data, with the microscope slide,
the number would be 1.17.

<P>I have been concerned about a probe with XY offsets from the nozzle,
so I currently use a probe which mounts directly under the nozzle,
and have no XY ofset (but my bed(:,3) offset is 11.45 for the larger probe).
We are not just measuring bed levels, but placement of the end-effector.
I worry that those XY offsets could be more complicated than our simplified
delta model allows.
The current simplfied delta model treats z offset pretty simply and reliably,
so I am less concerned about Z offset errors.

<p>There are two parameters needed besides the bed probe data
to guess at calibration errors.
They are the length of the diagonal rods, pivot-center to pivot-center,
and the DELTA_RADIUS setting.
Place these values in a structure with commands like:</p><pre>  DP.RodLen=217.95;
  DP.radius=108.2+[0,0,0];
</pre>
Where the RodLen field is the value of your DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD setting,
and the radius field is the value of your DELTA_RADIUS macro setting from
Configuration.h.

<p>The calibration error estimate takes some time, and you will not
be able to see the progress messages unless you disable the Octave
output pager:</p><pre>   more off
</pre>

<p>Now you are ready to guess the calibration errors for the DELTA_RADIUS
setting, and the endstop offsets:</p>
<pre>   [deltaErr,towerErr]=guessDeltaErr4(DP,bed)
</pre>

This will produce a plot of the bed probe values, with a quadratic
fit surface, a plot of the best-fit distorted surface that fits your bed probes, with a quadratic fit to these points, and finally a simple plot showing
all of your measurements, along with the distorted bed best-fit to those measurements.

<p>To update your calibration, add the towerErr value to your
endstop offsets (M666 setting), and add the deltaErr value
to your DELTA_RADIUS setting.

</p><p>I prefer to get the surface fairly flat before I really trust the
deltaErr value and apply it.

Once you have the basic bed calibration close enough to print, from the
above procedure you can continue to the full calibration procedure.

<P>Clear any auto-bed-leveling (tram) adjustments, and perform a
thorough bed level probe, saving the data.
Do bed-leveling (tram) adjustments as necessary to be able to print.
Then print the
<A HREF="http://boim.com/DeltaUtil/deltaTestA.scad">
calibration object</A>.

<P>The command<PRE>
     computeCalDist.pl XYcalPointsA.dat XYcalPairsA.dat > XYcalDist.dat
</PRE>
will produce a file of ideal measurements on this test object.
Using the figure shown here, edit this file to show the values of these
distances as measured with calipers.
Do not attempt to adjust for printer spread.  Printer spread will
be estimated and reported as part of the calibration process.
<IMG width="50%" align="right" SRC="http://boim.com/DeltaUtil/deltaTestA.svg">

<P>Load the bed probe as described above, and adjust for probe sensor offset.

<P>Now you can run a full parameter calibration with a command like:<PRE>
     [te,re,de,spread,DP1] = deltaCalXYZ(rodLen,radii,...
          'XYcalPoints.A.dat','XYcalPairs,dat','myXYdist.dat',endStops0)
</PRE>
where rodLen is diagonal rod length, measured.
radii are the delta tower radii, individual for each tower.
Names of measurement definition files, and cal print measurements.
if you provide endStops0, there is code that will automatically
add the endstop error estimate, te, to these endstops, and print
out the desired M666 command to set all calibration parameters under
<A HREF="https://github.com/Mr-What/DeltaUtil">Mr-What's fork of Johann's Marlin</A>.
Otherwise, you can add the reported error estimates to your settings
for endstops, delta radius (per each tower), diagonal rod length respectively.
